Question 1: What type of variables has the Iris dataset? Refer the type of each variable.
sepal_length: continuous variable (ordinal, numerical value)
sepal_width: continuous variable (ordinal, numerical value)
petal_length: continuous variable (ordinal, numerical value)
petal_width: continuous variable (ordinal, numerical value)
species: categorical variable (nominal, no intrinsic order)

Question 2: How many features are included in the Iris data set? Definition of a feature? 
- If each attribute is a feature then the dataset contains four features
- If the plot is referenced then the graphic has three features x & y coordinate and the color of the circle
- If a feature is a real life attribute than the graphic contains two (sepal and petal)

Question 3 - Compare the clustering results with the original data
- The error rate is very low. Only a very small number of values are erronous. 

Qustion 4 - What should be done to avoid overly dominat values or attributes? 
- The values need to be normalized to a range between 0 and 1. 
=> Standard distribution with mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1.  

Question 5 - Which class presents the higher correlation? 
The setosa flower type with a correlation of 0.747 between sepal length and width.

Question 6 - Which cluster presents the highest similarity and which one the highest dissimilarity? 
Highest similarity: Versicolor vs. Virginica
Value: 0.3816

Highest dissimilarity: Setosa vs. Virginica
Value: 4.7526
