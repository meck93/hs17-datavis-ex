**How to display the dashboard?**
* Prerequisites: Python 2.7.* and Tornado 4.3 (otherwise the callbacks of the sliders will not work)

To just display the dashboard (no interactivity): Open the ex2_main.html file

**Interactive Version:**
1. Ensure you have Python 2.7.* and Tornado 4.3 installed
2. Open a command prompt 
3. Navigate to the folder containing the files (ex2_main.py & image.jpg)
4. Run 'bokeh serve --show ex2_main.py'
5. If the browser doesn't open automatically: Open http://localhost:5006/ex2_main
6. Wait until the page has loaded completly. Try adjusting the sliders.
